# Wagon Card App
I want to create a loco- and wagon-card app that is easy to read and with high grapical standard.
These cards will only contain essential details that are of common interest or are necessary for operation at an average meeting.

## Loco Card
The design and print of the loco-card now seems to work, see example below.
I addition to the loco-card, you get a FRED-stcker and an inventory card. 
The idena with an inventory card is that you remove it from the loco card pocket when you place the loco on a track.
Then you know that you should collect the loco before travelling home after the meeting
