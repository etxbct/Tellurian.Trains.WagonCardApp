# Loco and Wagon Card App
This app helps the *module model railwayer* to 
create *freight wagon*- and *loco* cards and print them. 

I wanted to create a loco- and wagon-card app that is easy to read and with high grapical standard.
These cards will only contain essential details that are of common interest or are necessary for operation at an average meeting.

The app supports English, German, Danish and Swedish. 

## Freight Wagon Card
I addition to the loco-card itself, you get an inventory card. 
The coloured frame adapts according the FREMO standard based on the vehicle class.

## Loco Card
I addition to the loco-card itself, you get a FRED-stcker and an inventory card. 
The loco functions are printed both on the loco card itself (F0-F15) and the FRED-sticker (F0-F8).

## FRED Sticker
The FRED sticker contains maximum 8 functions, and this is because many FRED's are limited to max F8,
and of limitated space. 

## Invenyory Cards
The idea with an inventory card is that you remove it from the loco/wagon-card pocket 
when you place the loco/wagon on a track.
You put the inventory card on the loco/wagon box.
Then you know that you should collect before travelling home after the meeting.
