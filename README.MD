# Wagon Card App
This app helps the *module model railwayer* to 
create loco cards and print them. Maybe printing of wagon cards will mbe added later. 

I wanted to create a loco- and wagon-card app that is easy to read and with high grapical standard.
These cards will only contain essential details that are of common interest or are necessary for operation at an average meeting.

The app supports English, German, Danish and Swedish. 


## Loco Card
The design and print of the loco-card now seems to work, see example below.
I addition to the loco-card, you get a FRED-stcker and an inventory card. 
* The FRED-sticker contains maximum 8 functions, and this is because many meetings use Digitrax central systems, 
most of them not upgraded and therefore limited to max F8. Other central systems, like Z21, supports up to F12 on FREDs.
* The idea with an inventory card is that you remove it from the loco card pocket when you place the loco on a track.
Then you know that you should collect the loco before travelling home after the meeting.
