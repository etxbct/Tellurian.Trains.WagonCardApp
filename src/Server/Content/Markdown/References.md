### Loco numbering
Since  2007 locomotives or other traction units in Europe have been given a 12-digit number.
Before that numbering was up to national bodies or railway companies.

The number consists of 4-digit international block, 7-digit national block and one check digit.
Note that the meaning of the 7 digits in the national block varies between countries.
